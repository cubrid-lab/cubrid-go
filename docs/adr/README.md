# Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)

ADRs preserve **why** a consequential technical or release decision was made, the realistic alternatives, the consequences, and the evidence required to confirm it. A design guide explains *how to implement* a choice; an ADR explains *why that choice was selected*. ADRs do not replace the implementation, tests, CI or the authoritative published package contract.

## Index

| ADR | Decision | Status |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [0001](0001-release-governance.md) | Release, SemVer and compatibility governance | Proposed (pending review of release policy) |
| [0002](0002-database-correctness-evidence.md) | CUBRID correctness and failure-evidence requirements | Proposed |

The separate **CUBRID-native architecture ADR** will be proposed in the existing architecture Draft PR, after the release policy is reviewed. A draft design is not an approved decision.

## ADR lifecycle

- **Proposed:** a design decision under review. No project-wide requirement is claimed accepted merely because this file was committed to a PR.
- **Accepted:** a maintainer explicitly approves the decision in a reviewed PR, with required final-head checks. Record the acceptance PR/date by editing status and the decision record, not by guessing the reviewer.
- **Superseded:** a new numbered ADR accepts a different decision and links back to this one. Keep historic records; do not silently rewrite the reasoning to match a later implementation.
- **Rejected:** retained for traceability when the chosen alternative is not adopted.

Create a monotonically numbered `NNNN-plain-language-topic.md` file for a **material choice** (release contract, compatibility boundary, storage/transaction model, migration policy). Do not write one for every trivial code refactor or test case. Required headings: **Status, Context, Decision, Alternatives considered, Consequences and trade-offs, Verification / acceptance criteria, References**. Explain observable impact rather than using opaque tracking identifiers as the title. Link specific source code, tests, ADRs or issues.

Release policy must be reviewed **before** progressing the separate architecture proposal to acceptance. Code-level regressions remain tracked in the existing issue backlog, and real CUBRID tests remain mandatory where the release makes database-behavior claims.
