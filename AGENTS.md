# AGENTS.md

## Shared issue and pull request policy

See [cubrid-lab issue, PR, and commit standard](https://github.com/cubrid-lab/.github/blob/main/docs/ISSUE_PR_COMMIT_STANDARD.md). Issues use a simple type-only title (`feat: ...`, `bug: ...`, `docs: ...`) without required module names. Describe the problem or goal, relevant evidence, and a verifiable outcome; keep implementation details provisional. Triage owns validity, duplicates, scope, priority and size. Pull requests and commits use the existing Conventional Commits/CI requirements and document actual changes and checks. Do not include internal agent instructions or personal comments in public issue prose.


## Purpose
`cubrid-go` provides a pure Go CUBRID driver and related ecosystem integrations.

## Read First
- `README.md`
- `PRD.md`
- `CONTRIBUTING.md`
- `docs/agent-playbook.md`

## Working Rules
- Preserve `database/sql` semantics and DSN behavior unless the change explicitly updates those contracts.
- Keep documentation examples synchronized with the real driver behavior.
- Prefer compatibility-safe changes to exported types and behavior.
- Add tests for protocol, scanning, or transaction changes.

## Development Workflow (cubrid-lab org standard)

Use **one review policy** for human-authored contributions and all coding
tools (OpenCode, Codex, Claude Code, ChatGPT, Copilot, and others).
No Oracle pre/post review or particular AI reviewer is required by tool.

1. **Implement:** scope a focused change, add relevant tests, and update
   affected documentation in the same PR (or explain why docs are unaffected).
2. **GitHub CI:** required GitHub Actions checks on the final PR head are
   authoritative. Run applicable language-specific lint, tests, documentation,
   integration and security checks. Local runs are encouraged, not a separate
   prerequisite for merging.
3. **Review:** check correctness, risk, tests, security and maintainability.
   Oracle, Copilot and `agent-review` are optional **advisory** evidence.
4. **Merge:** address or disposition findings, verify required checks, and
   have the responsible maintainer decide on merge. Security-sensitive
   CI permissions, authentication and publishing changes require an
   independent maintainer's assessment.

Preserve existing branch protections, CI gates, integration tests, releases
and protected security paths. No automatic approval follows from green CI or
AI summaries.

## Validation
- `go test ./...`
- `make vet`
- `make test-cov`

## Human-readable communication (all agents)

Use this rule for text authored or edited by Codex, Claude Code, OpenCode,
ChatGPT, Copilot, or any other agent. It applies to issues, PRs, reviews,
comments, checklists, status updates, commit summaries, release notes,
documentation, presentations, and other maintainer-facing writing.

- Write for a reader unfamiliar with the underlying script, storyboard,
  automation run, or agent plan. Name the actual project, component,
  action, evidence, and location in ordinary, clear language.
- Never use unexplained internal identifiers as reader-facing labels or
  checklist instructions (for example, `H1, P1, C1, K1, F2` or `A1/B1/R1/R2`).
  Do not substitute `P1`/`P2` for repository priority labels.
- When an internal identifier is necessary for accurate cross-reference,
  **describe the subject first**, then add the identifier in context:
  `pycubrid introduction (0:20; storyboard shot P1)`. Use descriptive
  names and timestamps, section titles, or paths wherever practical.
- Use natural, actionable wording. Prefer `Listen to the full narration and
  verify the pronunciation of each project name` to `Maintainer full listen`.
  Avoid compressed task fragments, unexplained acronyms, and generated
  process/status jargon.
- Keep legitimate technical identifiers unchanged in code, tests, structured
  data, logs, specifications, and exact evidence references. Issue numbers,
  filenames, command names, APIs, error codes, and hashes are not prohibited.
  Do not break machine-readable references to improve prose.
- Before publishing, reread the text as a first-time maintainer. It should
  state what happened or needs to happen, why, and where without requiring a
  separate lookup table. Edit an existing editable comment to correct unclear
  wording rather than adding redundant follow-up comments.

This is a shared writing convention, not a new CI check, reviewer approval,
or merge gate. Keep existing repository-specific technical and safety rules.
