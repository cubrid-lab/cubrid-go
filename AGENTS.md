# AGENTS.md

## Purpose
`cubrid-go` provides a pure Go CUBRID driver and related ecosystem integrations.

## Read First
- `README.md`
- `PRD.md`
- `CONTRIBUTING.md`
- `docs/agent-playbook.md`

## Working Rules
- Preserve `database/sql` semantics and DSN behavior unless the change explicitly updates those contracts.
- Keep documentation examples synchronized with the real driver behavior.
- Prefer compatibility-safe changes to exported types and behavior.
- Add tests for protocol, scanning, or transaction changes.

## Development Workflow (cubrid-lab org standard)

Use **one review policy** for human-authored contributions and all coding
tools (OpenCode, Codex, Claude Code, ChatGPT, Copilot, and others).
No Oracle pre/post review or particular AI reviewer is required by tool.

1. **Implement:** scope a focused change, add relevant tests, and update
   affected documentation in the same PR (or explain why docs are unaffected).
2. **GitHub CI:** required GitHub Actions checks on the final PR head are
   authoritative. Run applicable language-specific lint, tests, documentation,
   integration and security checks. Local runs are encouraged, not a separate
   prerequisite for merging.
3. **Review:** check correctness, risk, tests, security and maintainability.
   Oracle, Copilot and `agent-review` are optional **advisory** evidence.
4. **Merge:** address or disposition findings, verify required checks, and
   have the responsible maintainer decide on merge. Security-sensitive
   CI permissions, authentication and publishing changes require an
   independent maintainer's assessment.

Preserve existing branch protections, CI gates, integration tests, releases
and protected security paths. No automatic approval follows from green CI or
AI summaries.

## Validation
- `go test ./...`
- `make vet`
- `make test-cov`
